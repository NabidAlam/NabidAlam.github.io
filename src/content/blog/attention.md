## üöÄ Introduction

Attention mechanism has revolutionized NLP and deep learning by allowing models to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating output‚Äîovercoming the bottleneck of fixed-size context vectors in classic encoder-decoder architectures.

---

## ‚ùì Why Do We Need Attention?

In vanilla Seq2Seq models, the encoder compresses the input into a fixed-size vector. This works fine for short sentences but fails with longer or complex ones. Attention solves this by dynamically weighting all encoder outputs during decoding.

---

## üîç How Attention Works

In each decoding step:

1. Compare the decoder‚Äôs current state with all encoder outputs.
2. Compute alignment scores.
3. Apply softmax to get attention weights.
4. Compute a context vector as the weighted sum of encoder outputs.
5. Combine it with the decoder state to predict the next token.

## üß† Types of Attention

- **Additive Attention** (Bahdanau)
- **Dot-Product Attention** (Luong)
- **Self-Attention** (used in Transformers)

We'll implement **Additive Attention** as it‚Äôs easier to understand.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Example with Python

### üìå Installing Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

---

### üìå Preparing Data

We'll use a dummy dataset for clarity.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Simulate encoder outputs (sequence of hidden states) and decoder hidden state
encoder_outputs = torch.randn(5, 1, 16)  # 5 timesteps, batch size 1, hidden size 16
decoder_hidden = torch.randn(1, 1, 16)   # current decoder hidden state
```

---

### üîß Implementing Additive Attention

```python
class AdditiveAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super(AdditiveAttention, self).__init__()
        self.attn = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, hidden_size)
        self.v = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(hidden_size))

    def forward(self, hidden, encoder_outputs):
        # Repeat decoder hidden state across sequence length
        seq_len = encoder_outputs.size(0)
        hidden = hidden.repeat(seq_len, 1, 1)

        # Calculate energy
        energy = torch.tanh(self.attn(torch.cat((hidden, encoder_outputs), dim=2)))
        energy = energy.transpose(1, 2)  # reshape for batch matrix multiplication

        # Learnable vector for scoring
        v = self.v.repeat(encoder_outputs.size(1), 1).unsqueeze(1)

        # Compute attention weights
        attention_weights = torch.bmm(v, energy).squeeze(1)
        return F.softmax(attention_weights, dim=1)
```

---

### ‚ûï Using It in Practice

```python
# Instantiate and apply attention mechanism
attention = AdditiveAttention(hidden_size=16)
weights = attention(decoder_hidden, encoder_outputs)
print("Attention weights:", weights)
```

This will output attention weights for each encoder timestep ‚Äî showing how much the decoder focuses on each input position during prediction.

---

## üéØ Summary

Attention allows neural networks to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input. It‚Äôs the foundation of modern architectures like Transformers and improves performance on tasks like translation, summarization, and more.
