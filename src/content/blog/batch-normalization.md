## üöÄ Introduction

Batch Normalization (BN) is a technique used in deep learning to **normalize activations** within a network, improving **training speed, stability, and performance**. It was introduced in 2015 by Ioffe and Szegedy and has since become a standard component in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## ‚ùì Why Do We Need Batch Normalization?

Training deep neural networks can be challenging due to issues such as **internal covariate shift** and **exploding/vanishing gradients**. Batch Normalization helps by:

- **Standardizing inputs to each layer** to prevent large variations in activations.
- **Accelerating training** by allowing higher learning rates.
- **Reducing sensitivity to weight initialization**.
- **Acting as a regularizer**, reducing the need for dropout in some cases.

## üîç How Batch Normalization Works

Batch Normalization is applied **after the convolutional layer (or fully connected layer) but before the activation function**. It standardizes activations using the formula:

1. Compute the **mean** and **variance** for each feature in a batch:
   $$
   \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i
   $$
   $$
   \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \mu)^2
   $$

2. Normalize the activations:
   $$
   \hat{x_i} = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}}
   $$

3. Scale and shift using learnable parameters \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \):
   $$
   y_i = \gamma \hat{x_i} + \beta
   $$

   where:
    - $ \gamma $ (scale) and $ \beta $ (shift) are **learnable parameters**.
    - $ \epsilon $ is a small constant for numerical stability.

### üìå Installing Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

### üîß Implementing Batch Normalization in PyTorch

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Define a simple CNN with Batch Normalization
class CNNWithBatchNorm(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNNWithBatchNorm, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)  # BatchNorm for 16 feature maps
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=16, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(32)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 10)  # Fully connected layer

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))  # Apply BatchNorm after conv
        x = torch.relu(self.bn2(self.conv2(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, start_dim=1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

# Initialize model
model = CNNWithBatchNorm()
print(model)
```

---

### ‚ûï Running the Code

```python
# Generate random input tensor simulating an image batch
input_tensor = torch.randn(4, 3, 32, 32)  # Batch of 4 images, 3 channels (RGB), 32x32 size

# Forward pass through the network
output = model(input_tensor)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)  # Should be (4, 10) for 10 classes
```

## üéØ Summary

- **Batch Normalization stabilizes training by normalizing activations within a batch**.
- **It speeds up training and allows for higher learning rates**.
- **It acts as a regularizer, reducing overfitting in deep networks**.
- **PyTorch provides `nn.BatchNorm2d()` for CNNs and `nn.BatchNorm1d()` for fully connected layers**.
